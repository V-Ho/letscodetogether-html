# letscodetogether-html

Welcome to the HTML Workshop for Let's Code Together 

How to create a simple website.
This demo consists of 2 pages:
1) hello.html
2) styles.css

hello.html shows the skeleton of a website, using the basic building blocks of an HTML page.  
It includes headers, ordered & unordered lists, links and images.
The site also uses simple CSS styling.

Styling is included in styles.css, which is then referenced in the <head> of hello.HTML
Feel free to clone this site and make it your own, personalising with colors, fonts, information about yourself and your own links & images.

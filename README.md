## Part 1 of the HTML & CSS Workshop 
### Let's Code Together - May 26, 2018

Welcome to the HTML Workshop for Let's Code Together 

How to create a simple website.
This demo consists of 2 pages:
1) hello.html
2) styles.css

### HTML
hello.html shows the skeleton of a website, using the basic building blocks of an HTML page.  
It includes headers, ordered & unordered lists, links and images.

### CSS
The CSS file shows basic CSS styling.  Here we introduce 3 types of CSS selectors:
1. Type Selectors 
  ex. h1, h2 {
      font-size: 24px;
     }
2. ID Selectors : unique id assigned to one element
  ex. #intro {
      border: 1px solid black;
     }
3. Class Selectors: class can be assigned to many different elements
  ex. .personal {
  text-align: center;
    }
 
 Feel free to play around with different styles and colors to personalize your own page.
